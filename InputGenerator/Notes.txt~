Important Notes:-
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<================================================>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

1.The virtual Memory data returned from /proc/self/status file gives in KB. I have converted the data to Bytes to get a better accuracy and fineness.

2.NEED To have a file written in /proc so that i can save the process ID of the process whose cpu usage i want to find

3. The cpu usage will be found by a different program and will be calculated in some regular intervals

4. While calculating the cpu usage percenatage we are considering  all the number of cpu.
