CProf is a C program profiler for linux machines to identify various process parameters. We can invoke the various methods to get information betwwen basic blocks or between lines of code.
The Profiler will identify the amount of memory my program is consuming at a particular block for different inputs and will also show the amount of cpu that is consumed. 

In order to identify the basic block we will have to use gcov offline and after identifying the source code i will modify the code in the individual basic blocks and call the respective method from CProf to get the respective details at that block.
