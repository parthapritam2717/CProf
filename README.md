# profiler
My personal profiler tool for my MTP work.
The Profiler will identify the amount of memory my program is consuming at a particular block for different inputs and will also show the amount of cpu that is consumed andf also the number of packets sent or generated till that block.

In order to identify the basic block we will have to use gcov offline and after identifying the source code i will modify the code in the individual basic blocks and try to extract informations from the Kernel.

With each iteration i will add separate README explaining the working and the 
method how to use that tool.
